# PRODIGY_SD_04
# 🧩 Sudoku Solver
This is an automatic Sudoku puzzle solver developed as part of my internship with **Prodigy Infotech**.

## 📌 Description
The program uses a **backtracking algorithm** to solve standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. It accepts a partially filled grid and outputs the completed solution.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Accepts the puzzle as a 2D list (9x9)
- Fills missing values using **recursive backtracking**
- Verifies if current placement is valid (row, column, 3x3 box)
- Stops when a valid solution is found and prints the solved grid
